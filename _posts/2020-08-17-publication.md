We introduce a novel safe route planning problem and develop an efficient solution to ensure the travelers' safety on roads. Our approach finds the safest routes within a user-specified distance threshold based on the personalized travel experience of the knowledgeable crowd without involving any centralized computation. Our algorithms for finding the safest route further enhance user privacy by minimizing the exposure of personalized safety scores with others. Our safe route planner can find the safest routes for individuals and groups by considering both a fixed and a set of flexible destination locations.
